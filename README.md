# mtlgreen_data

## Usage

Requires python 3.5+

look in the `demo.py` file to see example usages of the api.

for impak scraping, you'll need the 'cookies.json', 
either use impak credentials and selenium (with Chrome) to get the cookies yourself, 
or get the file from Ryan (I'll send them to you on Slack)

     python3 -i demo.py
